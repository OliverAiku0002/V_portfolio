        A fast-developed endless runner-style parkour game built in Unity within just 5–6 hours, featuring dynamic movement and obstacle-reactive animations for a fluid and immersive gameplay experience. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Endless Runner Gameplay: The level continuously spawns obstacles of varying shapes and sizes, ensuring each run feels fresh and unpredictable.
        <br>
        <br>
        Obstacle-Driven Parkour Animations: Instead of relying on player height, the game automatically selects the correct parkour animation based on obstacle mesh data—including height, width, and overall structure.
 Depending on the obstacle, the character will intelligently perform actions like jumping, sliding, vaulting, or other parkour movements.
        <br>
        <br>
        Smooth Animation Transitions: All animations blend seamlessly to maintain a fast, fluid parkour experience. Movements adapt in real time to obstacle dimensions and player speed.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dynamic Parkour Mechanics: Players can jump over small obstacles, slide beneath low barriers, and vault across wider or taller structures. Every parkour action is driven by accurate mesh analysis of the upcoming obstacle.
